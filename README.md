__3. SRC:__ Python scripts for data loading, cleaning, and analysis.

__4. README.md:__ This readme file.

__5. Results:__ Contains the generated plots and analysis results.
## Usage
 __1. Data Preparation:__

i. Place the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 bowling stats dataset in the data/ directory.

ii. Ensure the dataset is in a CSV format.

__2. Running the Analysis:__

 i. Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the Jupyter notebook.

ii. Run the cells sequentially to load the data,  clean it, perform analysis, and generate visualizations.

__3. Visualizing the Results:__

i. The visualizations generated during the analysis are saved in the results/ directory.

ii. Use these visualizations to understand the bowling performance in the tournament
## Results
__Economy Rate Analysis:__ Visualizations show the distribution of economy rates, highlighting the consistency of bowlers throughout the tournament.

__Top Performers:__ Analysis identifies the 
top-performing bowlers based on wickets taken, economy rate, and strike rate.

__Team Performance:__ Comparative analysis of team bowling performances
